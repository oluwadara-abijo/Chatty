/**
 * A [Graph] represents a nested Navigation-Graph that can defined within the app. Some apps
 * can have multiple nested navigation graphs; for example in the case of a bottom navigation
 * and each tab should retain its own back stack.
 *
 * By defining a [Graph] for each bottom navigation destination, we can then define a set of
 * [Destination]s within that [Graph] that can be navigated to.
 *
 * In the case of no bottom navigation, or not wanting to retain a back stack of each tabs
 * navigation hierarchy, we create a single [Graph] and simply define a set of all the
 * [Destination]s on that single [Graph]
 *
 * @property route The unique path for this particular graph.
 * (For example: 'shop' for the shop tab.)
